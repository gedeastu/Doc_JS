// type "let" is good when you wanna make a variable and you could to changes a new value on this variable
// let age = 18;
// console.log(`hi, you're too young ${age}`)

// type "const" is good when wanna make the variable with a absolute value
// note: "const" is doesn't changes the value if you did 
// const yourAge = 10;
// yourAge = 20;
// console.log(`hi, you're too young ${yourAge}`)
